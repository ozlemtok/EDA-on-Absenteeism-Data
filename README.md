# Exploratory Data Analysis on Absenteeism Data
My purpose in this project is to find if there is any characteristic(such as age, number of children, month) affects the absent time.
I used the Absenteeism data from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project starts with obtaining and cleaning the data. Then, 
I used barplots, scatterplots, histograms and correlation matrix to make univariate and multivariate data analysis. 

Some of the outcomes from the analysis are as follows;

* Most absent hours are observed in March and July.
* People are being absent mostly in the season Spring.
* People are tend to be absent at work mostly at the begining of the week, especially on Mondays. 
* People with no children have been absent more times than people with children. 
However, in terms of total hours of absenteeism, people have 2 children have more absent time than other categories.

### Data

in Brazil. There are 740 rows and 21 columns in the data.
